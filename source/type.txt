\subsection type-description Description

With no options, `type` indicates how each `NAME` would be interpreted if used as a command name.

The following options are available:

- `-h` or `--help` prints help and then exits.
- `-a` or `--all` prints all of possible definitions of the specified names.
- `-f` or `--no-functions` suppresses function and builtin lookup.
- `-t` or `--type` prints `keyword`, `function`, `builtin`, or `file` if `NAME` is a shell reserved word, function, builtin, or disk file, respectively.
- `-p` or `--path` returns the name of the disk file that would be executed, or nothing if 'type  -t  name' would not return 'file'.
- `-P` or `--force-path` returns the name of the disk file that would be executed, or nothing no file with the specified name could be found in the `$PATH`.

`type` sets the exit status to 0 if the specified command was found,
and 1 if it could not be found.

\subsection type-example Example

`type fg` outputs the string '`fg is a shell builtin`'.
