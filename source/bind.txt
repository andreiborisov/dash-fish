\section bind bind - Handle key bindings.

\subsection bind-synopsis Synopsis
<tt>bind [OPTIONS] [BINDINGS...]</tt>

The <tt>bind</tt> builtin causes fish to add the readline style bindings specified by BINDINGS to the list of key bindings, as if they appeared in your <tt>~/.fish_inputrc</tt> file.

For more information on the syntax keyboard bindings, use <tt>man
readline</tt> to access the readline documentation. The availiable commands
are listed in the <a href="index.html#editor">Command Line Editor</a> section
of the fish manual - but you may also use any fish command! To write such
commands, see the <a href="#commandline">commandline</a> builtin. It's good
practice to put the code into a <tt><a href="#function">function</a> -b</tt>
and bind to the function name.

\subsection bind-description Description
