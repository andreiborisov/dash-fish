\subsection cd-description Description
Changes the current directory. If <tt>DIRECTORY</tt> is supplied it
will become the new directory. If \c DIRECTORY is a relative path, the
CDPATH environment variable will be separated using the : as
separator, and the resulting list will be searched for a suitable new
current directory. If CDPATH is not set, it is assumed to be '.'. If
\c DIRECTORY is not specified, \$HOME will be the new directory.
