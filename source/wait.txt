\subsection wait-description Description

`wait` waits for child processes to complete. If a pid is specified, the command waits for that pid. If no pid is specified, the command waits for all background processes.

If the `-n` / `--any` flag is provided, the command returns as soon as the first subprocess completes. If it is not provided, it returns after all subprocesses complete.

\subsection wait-example Example

`sleep 10 & ; wait %1` spawns sleep in the background, and then waits until it finishes.
