\section switch switch - conditionally execute a block of commands

\subsection switch-synopsis Synopsis
 <tt>switch VALUE; [case [WILDCARD...]; [COMMANDS...];...] end</tt>

\subsection switch-description Description

The \c switch statement is used to perform one of several blocks of
commands depending on whether a specified value equals one of several
wildcarded values.

\subsection switch-example Example

If the variable \$animal contins the name of an animal, the
following code would attempt to classify it:

<p>
<pre>
switch $animal
    case cat
        echo evil
    case wolf dog human moose dolphin whale
        echo mammal
    case duck goose albatros
        echo bird
    case shark trout stingray
        echo fish
end
</pre>
</p>
<p>

If the above code was run with \$animal set to \c whale, the output
would be \c mammal.  

</p>
