\subsection fishd-description Description

The \c fishd daemon is used to load, save and distribute universal
variable information. fish automtically connects to fishd via a socket
on startup. If no instance of fishd is running, fish spawns a new
fishd instance. fishd will create a socket in /tmp, and wait for
incoming connections from universal variable clents, such as fish,
When no clients are connected, fishd will automatically shut down.
