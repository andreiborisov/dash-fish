\subsection umask-synopsis Synopsis
<code>umask [OPTIONS] [MASK]</code>

\subsection umask-description Description

With no argument, the current file-creation mask is printed, if an
argument is specified, it is the new file creation mask. The mask may
be specified as an octal number, in which case it is interpreted as
the rights that should be masked away, i.e. it is the inverse of the
file permissions any new files will have. If a synbolic mask is
specified, the actual file permission bits, and not the inverse, are
specified.

- <code>-h</code> or <code>--help</code> print this message
- <code>-S</code> or <code>--symbolic</code> prints the file-creation mask in symbolic form instead of octal form. Use <code>man chmod</code> for more information.
- <code>-p</code> or <code>--as-command</code> prints any output in a form that may be reused as input

The umask implementation in fish should behave identically to the one
in bash.

\subsection umask-example Example

<code>umask 177</code> or <code>umask u=rw</code>sets the file
creation mask to read and write for the owner and no permissions at
all for any other users.
