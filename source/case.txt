\section case case - conditionally execute a block of commands

\subsection case-synopsis Synopsis
<tt>switch VALUE; [case [WILDCARD...]; [COMMANDS...];...] end</tt>

\subsection case-description Description

The \c switch statement is used to perform one of several blocks of
commands depending on whether a specified value equals one of several
wildcarded values. The \c case statement is used together with the \c
switch statement in order to determine which block should be
performed.

\subsection case-example Example

If the variable \$animal contains the name of an animal, the following
code would attempt to classify it:

<p>
<pre>
switch $animal
    case cat
        echo evil
    case wolf dog human moose dolphin whale
        echo mammal
    case duck goose albatros
        echo bird
    case shark trout stingray
        echo fish
end
</pre>
</p>
<p>
If the above code was run with \$animal set to \c whale, the output would be \c mammal.
</p>
