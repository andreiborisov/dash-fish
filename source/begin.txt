\section begin begin - Start a new block of code

\subsection begin-synopsis Synopsis
 <tt>begin; [COMMAND;...] end </tt>

\subsection begin-description Description

The \c begin builtin is used to create a new block of code. The block
is unconditionally erxecuted. Begin is equivalent to <tt>if
true</tt>. The begin command is used to group any number of commands
into a block. The reason for this is usually either to introduce a new
variable scope or to redirect the input ot output of this set of
commands as a group.

\subsection begin-example Example

The following code sets a number of variables inside of a block
scope. Since the variables are set inside the block and have local
scope, they will be automatically deleted when the block ends.

<pre>
begin
	set -x PIRATE Yarrr
	...
end
# This will not output anything, since PIRATE went out of scope at the end of
# the block and was killed
echo $PIRATE
</pre>
