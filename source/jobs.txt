\subsection jobs-description Description
The <tt>jobs</tt> builtin causes fish to print a list of the currently
running jobs and their status. 

On systems that supports this feature, jobs will also print the CPU
usage of each job since the last command was executed. The CPU usage
is expressed as a percentage of full CPU activity. Note that on
multiprocessor systems, the total activity may be more than 100\%.
