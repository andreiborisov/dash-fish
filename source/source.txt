\section source . - evaluate contents of file.

\subsection source-synopsis Synopsis
<tt>. FILENAME</tt>

\subsection source-description Description 

Evaluates the commands of the specified file in the current
shell. This is different from starting a new process to perform the
commands (i.e. <tt>fish < FILENAME</tt>) since the commands will be
evaluated by the current shell, which means that changes in
environment variables, etc., will remain.

\subsection source-example Example

<tt>. ~/.fish</tt>

causes fish to reread its initialization file.
