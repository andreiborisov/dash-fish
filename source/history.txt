\subsection history-description Description

`history` is used to list, search and delete the history of commands used.

The following options are available:
- `--save` saves all changes in the history file. The shell automatically saves the history file; this option is provided for internal use.
- `--clear` clears the history file. A prompt is displayed before the history is erased.
- `--merge` immediately incorporates history changes from other sessions. Ordinarily fish ignores history changes from sessions started after the current one. This command applies those changes immediately.
- `--search` returns history items in keeping with the `--prefix` or `--contains` options.
- `--delete` deletes history items.
- `--prefix` searches or deletes items in the history that begin with the specified text string.
- `--contains` searches or deletes items in the history that contain the specified text string.

If `--search` is specified without `--contains` or `--prefix`, `--contains` will be assumed.

If `--delete` is specified without `--contains` or `--prefix`, only a history item which exactly matches the parameter will be erased. No prompt will be given. If `--delete` is specified with either of these parameters, an interactive prompt will be displayed before any items are deleted.

\subsection history-examples Example

`history --clear` deletes all history items

`history --search --contains "foo"` outputs a list of all previous
commands containing the string "foo".

`history --delete --prefix "foo"` interactively deletes the record
of previous commands which start with "foo".
