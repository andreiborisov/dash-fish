\subsection history-description Description

`history` is used to list, search and delete the history of commands used.

The following options are available:
- `--merge` immediately incorporates history changes from other sessions. Ordinarily `fish` ignores history changes from sessions started after the current one. This command applies those changes immediately.

- `--save` saves all changes in the history file. The shell automatically saves the history file; this option is provided for internal use.

- `--clear` clears the history file. A prompt is displayed before the history is erased.

- `--search` returns history items in keeping with the `--prefix` or `--contains` options. Without either, `--contains` will be assumed.

- `--delete` deletes history items. Without the `--prefix` or `--contains` options, the exact match will be deleted. With either of these options, a prompt will be displayed before any items are deleted.

- `--prefix` searches or deletes items in the history that begin with the specified text string.

- `--contains` searches or deletes items in the history that contain the specified text string.

\subsection history-examples Example

\fish
history --clear
# Deletes all history items

history --search --contains "foo"
# Outputs a list of all previous commands containing the string "foo".

history --delete --prefix "foo"
# Interactively deletes the record of previous commands which start with "foo".
\endfish
